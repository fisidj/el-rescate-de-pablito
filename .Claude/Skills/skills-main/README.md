# Roblox Skills & Claude Code Extensions

Personal collection of [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home), hooks, and
plugins for Claude Code, focused on Roblox development.

This started as a fork of [antfu/skills](https://github.com/antfu/skills). I'm
repurposing it for my own workflow but keeping it open source in case others
find it useful.

## What's here

- **Skills** - Agent skills for Roblox tooling, Luau, and related ecosystems
- **Hooks** - Custom Claude Code hooks for my workflow
- **Plugins** - Any other extensions I end up building

## Installation

```bash
pnpx skills add christopher-buss/skills -skill='*'
```

Or install everything globally:

```bash
pnpx skills add christopher-buss/skills -skill='*' -g
```

More on the CLI at [skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

## Attribution

Forked from [Anthony Fu's skills](https://github.com/antfu/skills). The original
project's approach of using git submodules to reference source documentation is
clever - skills stay current with upstream changes without manual updates.
